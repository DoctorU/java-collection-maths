### What is it?

A play a creating mathematical and statistical library functions in a java project, backed with maven.

### How to use it?

It generates a package. You should be able to build it, then push it to your repo.

From the command line:

    mvn clean install test

will clean, build, install and run the tests.

    mvn surefire-report:report-only

will subsequently build the test report as well.

### Where has it gone?

    orgId:      com.stevehobdell
    artifactId: java-stats
    version:    0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
    jar:        java-stats-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


### Summary

This is a significant work in progress, and will only be used/modified when I need to!
